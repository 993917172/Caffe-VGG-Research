# Caffe-VGG-Research
## Train Model
#### 01.caffe_train.ipynb
It's used for data to training.The notebook can quickly start the training with few code of path assigned.

## Predict Data
#### 02.caffe_predict.ipynb
It's used for data to predicting.The notebook can quickly predict a bunch of data with few code of path assigned.

## Prune Model
#### 03.VGG-DictNet-Prune.ipynb
Prune VGG-DictNet Model by coarse-pruning

## Use Auto-encoder to help training
#### 04.VGG_autoencoder.ipynb
Train Auto-encoders' Convolutional Layer to Concate on VGG-DictNet and add FC Layers.
